"""Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted to a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who allegedly used it to communicate with his generals.

For example:
Input: "defend the east wall of the castle"
Output: "efgfoe uif fbtu xbmm pg uif dbtumf"

Write a program that encrypts the user input using the Caesar cipher. *bonus: write the decryption cipher."""
